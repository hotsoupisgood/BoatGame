Game about upside-down coal-steam ships fighting to score goals on each other.
The physics of controlling the ships is supposed to be hard.
The janky nature of how things control is some of the fun because I cannot think of anything else that would be fun ever...
*Shippy prefab has to be told what ball its going after(should probibly fix this to be dynamic)
